This script is designed to fully automate the process of turning a Raspberry Pi into a working Access Point

## Overview

Currently the script is created to check for the hardware requirements of the Raspberry Pi as well as automatically install `hostapd` and `dnsmasq`
The file sets up dnsmasq and hostapd files as well as a way to customize how you want the Access Point to be created
